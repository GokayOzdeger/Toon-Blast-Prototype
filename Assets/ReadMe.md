# Toon Blast Prototype

### Notice
Welcome to the first `README` file of the project,  
you will come across more `README` files around the project just like this one.

### A General Hello

Hello I am `GÃ¶kay`,  
It was a real rollercoaster of a case study for me.  
In my company we mostly work on 3D projects but i feel like this case study turned out great.  
If we exteremely summarize whats going on in this project:  
  
There is a `Grid` with `GridEntities` in it who does their own things,  
when every entity feels ready the `Grid` becomes interractable,  
Lots of fancy DoTween stuff happends and a lot of configurations available for different levels.

### What do we have ?

Here are some links for you to jump around the project:

 * [Data](_Data/ReadMe.md)
 * [Scripts](_Scripts/ReadMe.md)
 * [Utilities](_Utilities/ReadMe.md)
 * [Plugins](Plugins/ReadMe.md)

The reason why i have "_" before most important folders are for them to appear on top of project view,  
Since as the project lasts longer, the more 3rd party services are installed,  
The main "Assets" folder starts to get polluted by services like Firebase, Facebook, Adjust, etc.

### Didn't have time for

I didnt have the time for a few topics since i was also working while developing this prototype in 7 days.

 * Extra Comments/Summaries and Code Regions

 * Assembly Definitions (Code Packaging and Refactoring out Circular References)

 * Game Config (a few references/variables that are general game settings are currently sitting in Level config, they should be moved to a GameConfig class)

 * Music/Other sound slider settings.

 * Unit Test (this was at the bottom of the list honestly i dont think it would showcase much about me)
